# Meta Analysis Ideas for TCG Application

## WHAT to Analyze

### Core Deck Components
- **Leaders**: Frequency and win rates of specific leader cards
- **Leaders + Bases**: Combinations and their performance metrics
- **Colors/Aspects**: Distribution and success rates of different color combinations
- **Archetypes**: Define and track broader deck archetypes beyond just leaders
- **Key Cards**: Identify and track frequently used non-leader cards across decks
- **Tech Cards**: Cards that appear in smaller numbers but have significant impact

### Advanced Analysis
- **Card Synergies**: Identify cards that frequently appear together
- **Mana/Resource Curves**: Analyze resource distribution in successful decks
- **Card Ratios**: Examine ratios between card types (e.g., units vs. events)
- **Sideboard Patterns**: If applicable, analyze sideboard choices and patterns

## HOW to Analyze

### Tournament Segments
- **Top 8/16/32/64 Decks**: Analysis of top-performing decks
- **Day 2 Qualifiers**: Decks that made it to day 2
- **All Decks**: Complete tournament meta picture
- **Winning Decks Only**: Focus only on decks that won matches

### Performance Metrics
- **Win Rate**: Overall win percentage for each deck type/leader/archetype
- **Conversion Rate**: Day 1 to Day 2 conversion rates for deck types
- **Representation vs. Performance**: Compare frequency of appearance to actual success
- **Match-up Analysis**: How specific decks/archetypes perform against others

### Visualization Methods
- **Meta Wheel**: Circular representation showing deck types and their relationships
- **Heat Maps**: Visual representation of match-up win rates
- **Trend Graphs**: Show how meta has evolved over time/tournaments
- **Pie Charts/Bar Graphs**: For simple distribution visualization

## Additional Features

### Time-Based Analysis
- **Meta Evolution**: Track changes in meta over multiple tournaments
- **Pre/Post Set Release**: Compare meta before and after new card releases
- **Season Tracking**: Track meta throughout a competitive season

### Player-Focused Analysis
- **Player Preferences**: Analyze deck choices by top players
- **Regional Differences**: Compare meta across different regions/continents
- **Innovation Tracking**: Identify players who introduce new deck types

### Comparative Tools
- **Tournament Comparison**: Compare meta between different tournaments
- **Format Comparison**: Compare meta across different formats if applicable
- **Expected vs. Actual Meta**: Compare pre-tournament predictions to results

## Implementation Ideas

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Allow users to filter and drill down into data
- **Customizable Reports**: Let users select which metrics to view
- **Data Export**: Allow downloading of analysis in various formats
- **Meta Predictions**: Use historical data to predict future trends
- **Deck Recommendation Engine**: Suggest decks based on current meta

These ideas can be implemented incrementally, starting with the most basic analyses (leader distribution, win rates) and gradually adding more sophisticated features as your platform evolves.
