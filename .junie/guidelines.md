VERY IMPORTANT/CRUCIAL:
- NEVER create tests for components (no files like `MyComponent.test.tsx`)
- NEVER create test files for components (no files like `test-my-component.tsx`)
- NEVER run `npm run type-check` commands
- NEVER create documentation in separate markdown file, unless asked to do so
- when creating react components, ALWAYS use react functional components (`const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({....`)
